            Hello, I am Mohammed
            - BSc in Computer Science
            - MSc in Artificial Intelligence
            - Computer Vision Enthusiast
            Graduate from Sheffield Hallam University with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence 
            I have received a Distinction classification. 
            I am particularly interested in Computer vision tasks, such as object detection and tracking. My recent work includes several works on the subject including my master's thesis. 
            This page showcases some of my projects. </p>

            <h3>Fall Detection</h3>
            <p>This repository contains a vision-based fall detection system developed using deep learning techniques and pose estimation models. The goal is to detect falls from video footage accurately and efficiently.
            This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques.
